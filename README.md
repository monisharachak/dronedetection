üöÅ Drone Detection Using YOLO and OpenCV This project implements a real-time drone detection system using the YOLO (You Only Look Once) object detection model with OpenCV and Python. The system can detect and localize drones in both images and live video streams (e.g., from a webcam or drone camera feed).
